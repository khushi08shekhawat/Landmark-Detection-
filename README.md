# Landmark Detection using CNNs üèõÔ∏è

This project focuses on identifying and classifying real-world landmarks using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It uses a custom dataset of monument images and trains a multi-class classifier using TensorFlow and Keras. The model aims to predict the correct landmark from a given image input.
